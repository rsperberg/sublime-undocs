Basic Concepts
==============


Overview
========

To fully understand the rest of this guide,
you need to be familiar
with the concepts presented in this section.


Conventions
===========

Written from the perspective of a Windows user,
most instructions will only require trivial changes
to work on other platforms.

Relative paths (e.g. :file:`Packages/User`) start at `the Data Directory`_
unless otherwise noted.

We assume default key bindings
when indicating keyboard shortcuts.
If you're using a non-English keyboard layout,
note that **some key bindings won't match
your locale's keyboard**.
This is due to the way Sublime Text
maps keys to commands.


With Great Power Comes A Lot of Questions
=========================================

Unquestionably a versatile tool for programmers,
you don't need to be one in order to
use Sublime Text,
or even to configure it extensively.
If you're a hacker, however, you are in
for a great many pleasant surprises:
Sublime Text can be infinitely customized and extended.
You can start using it efficiently out of the box,
but spending some time tailoring it
to your exact needs will make it even better.

This guide will teach you
how to configure Sublime Text.

Sublime Text can't be mastered in a day,
but it's built on a handful of pervasive ideas
that make for a consistent
and easily understandable system
once all the pieces come together.

In the following paragraphs,
we'll outline key aspects
that may not click in your mind until
you've spent some time using the editor.
Experiment, look around in this guide
and, eventually, everything will fall into place.


The *Data* Directory
====================

Nearly all of the interesting files for users
live under the data directory.
This is a platform-dependent location:

.. XXX I'm using the portable installation, so double check this.

* **Windows**: *%APPDATA%\\Sublime Text 3*
* **OS X**: *~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3*
* **Linux**: *~/.config/sublime-text-3*

For **portable installations**,
look inside *Sublime Text 3/Data*.
Here, the *Sublime Text 3* part
refers to the directory
to which you've extracted the compressed portable files.

Note that only in portable installations
does a directory named *Data* exist.
For the remaining installation types,
the data directory is the location
indicated above.


The *Packages* Directory
==============================

This is a **key directory**:
all resources for supported programming and markup languages
are stored here.
A *package* is a directory or zip file
containing related files
having a special meaning for Sublime Text.

You can access the packages directory
from the main menu (**Preferences | Browse Packages...**),
or by means of an API call: ``sublime.packages_path()``.
In this guide, we refer to this location
as *Packages*, *packages path*, *packages folder* or *packages directory*.

The ``User`` Package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:file:`Packages/User` is a catch-all directory
for custom plugins, snippets, macros, etc.
Consider it your personal area
in the packages folder.
Sublime Text will never overwrite the contents of :file:`Packages/User`
during upgrades.


The Python Console and the Python API
=====================================

This information is especially interesting
for programmers.
For other users,
you just need to know
that Sublime Text
enables users with programming skills
to add their own features to the editor.
(So go learn how to program;
it's great fun!)

Sublime Text comes with an embedded Python interpreter.
It's a useful tool
to inspect the editor's settings
and to quickly test API calls
while developing plugins.

To open the Python console,
press :kbd:`Ctrl+\``
or select **View | Show Console**
from the main menu.

Confused?
Let's try again more slowly:

*Python* is a programming language
known to be easy for beginners and very powerful
at the same time.
*API* is short for 'Application Programming Interface',
which is a fancy way of saying that Sublime Text 3
is prepared to be programmed by the user.
Put differently,
Sublime Text gives the user access to its internals
through Python.
Finally, a *console* is a little window inside Sublime Text
that lets you type in short snippets of Python code
and run them.
The console also shows
text output by Sublime Text or its plugins.


Your System's Python vs the Sublime Text 3 Embedded Python
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sublime Text 3 comes with its own Python interpreter
and it's separate
from your system's Python installation.

The embedded interpreter is intended only
to interact with the plugin API,
not for general development.


Packages, Plugins, Resources and Other Things That May Not Make Sense to You Now
================================================================================

Almost every aspect of Sublime Text
can be extended or customized.
For now, this is all you need to understand.
This vast flexibility is the reason
why you will learn about so many configuration files:
there simply must be a place
to specify all your preferences.

Among other things,
you can modify the editor's behavior,
add macros and snippets, extend menus...
and even create whole new features
--where *feature* means 'anything you can think of'.
OK, right, there might be things
you can't do, but you're definitely
spoiled for choice.

All these configuration files
we're referring to
are simple text files
following a special structure or *format*:
JSON predominates, but you'll find
some XML files,
and Python files too
for the more advanced extensibility options.

In this guide, for brevity,
we refer collectively to all these
disparate configuration files as *resources*.

Sublime Text will look for resources
inside the packages folder.
And what is a package, you ask?
We'll talk at length about them,
but the short version is that,
to keep things tidy,
the editor has a notion of a *package*,
which is a folder containing resources
that belong together
(maybe they all help
compose emails faster, write HTML efficiently,
enhance the coding experience for C, Ruby, Go...).


Textmate Compatibility
======================

This information is mainly useful
for Textmate expats
who've found a new home in Sublime Text.
Textmate is an editor for the Mac.

Sublime Text compatibility with Textmate bundles
is good excluding commands,
which are incompatible.
Additionally, Sublime Text requires
all syntax definitions to have the *.tmLanguage* extension,
and all preferences files
to have the *.tmPreferences* extension.
This means that *.plist* files
will be ignored,
even if they are located
under a *Syntaxes* or *Preferences* subdirectory.


Vi/Vim Emulation
================

This information is mainly useful
for dinosaurs and people who like to
drop the term RSI in conversations.
Vi is an ancient modal editor
that lets the user perform all operations
from the keyboard.
Vim, a modern version of vi,
is still in widespread use.

Sublime Text provides vi emulation
through the *Vintage* package.
The Vintage package is *ignored* by default.
Read more about Vintage_
in the official documentation.

An evolution of Vintage called Vintageous_
offers a better Vi editing experience
and is updated more often than Vintage.
Vintageous_ is an open source project.

Emacs
=====

This information is hardly useful for anyone.
Emacs is...
Well, nobody really knows what emacs is,
but some people edit text with it.

If you are an emacs user,
you're probably not reading this.
